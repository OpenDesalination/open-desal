Desalination is a process that takes away mineral components from saline water. More generally, desalination refers to the removal of salts and minerals from a target substance,[1] as in soil desalination, which is an issue for agriculture. Saltwater (especially sea water) is desalinated to produce water suitable for human consumption or irrigation. The by-product of the desalination process is brine. Desalination is used on many seagoing ships and submarines. Most of the modern interest in desalination is focused on cost-effective provision of fresh water for human use. Along with recycled wastewater, it is one of the few rainfall-independent water resources.

Due to its energy consumption, desalinating sea water is generally more costly than fresh water from surface water or groundwater, water recycling and water conservation. However, these alternatives are not always available and depletion of reserves is a critical problem worldwide. Desalination processes are usually driven by either thermal (in the case of distillation) or mechanical (in the case of reverse osmosis) as the primary energy types. (source: wikipedia)

Desalination plants are costly to make and maintain. In this organization our effort is to help provide a frame work for innovators to create systems that are envioronmentally sustainable and cost effective to create and maintain. 

The goal of this repot is to come up with cheap design that can reduce the cost of desalination by 10x. Anyone interested in this project please contact us.
